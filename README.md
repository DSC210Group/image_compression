# image_compression

In this project, we initially explore the linear algebraic methods using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principle Components Analysis (PCA), Walshâ€“Hadamard Transformation (WHT) and Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) to extract important components of images and then we look at a AI-based state of art image compression called MLIC++.

We perform experiments on Kodak image dataset, composing of 24 pieces of lossless, true color (24 bits per pixel, aka "full color") images (You can find the image dataset here: https://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/).

The structure of this repository:
- pca: fold contains the code to perform PCA
- result_comparison: fold contains the code to evaluate different methods by computing metrics
