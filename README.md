# image_compression

In this project, we initially explore the linear algebraic methods using Singular Value Decomposition (SVD), Principle Components Analysis (PCA), Walshâ€“Hadamard Transformation (WHT) and Discrete Cosine Transformation (DCT) to extract important components of images and then we look at a AI-based state of art image compression called MLIC++.

We perform experiments on Kodak image dataset, composing of 24 pieces of lossless, true color (24 bits per pixel, aka "full color") images (You can find the image dataset here: https://r0k.us/graphics/kodak/).

The structure of this repository:
- PCA&SVD: fold contains the code to perform PCA and SVD
- WHT&DCT: fold contains the code to perform WHT and DCT, see more [README](./DCT&WHT/README.md)
- SOTA: fold contains the code to perform SOTA method (MLIC++)
- result_comparison: fold contains the code to evaluate different methods by computing metrics
